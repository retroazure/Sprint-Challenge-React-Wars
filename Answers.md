1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

1. Describe component state.

Component state allows for different component changes, the state is what defines what kind of value that component is holding, whether this is static or dynamic.

1. Describe props.
A prop is merely an object holder, it holds all the properties of the react components that you create. When you create a component using react, you can destructure different variables just by using props. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
Side effects allow an action to happen after a component changes its state or properties. The mostly common function to using sync effects is useEffect() in react.
